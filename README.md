When you follow this instructions, you can deploy Eula by yourself. You can either just run the bot, or you can use Docker to deploy the bot.

### Installing Dev Env

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
First, clone the repository. You need atleast Node v16.8.0 to run this bot. Its also recommended to use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

Install all packages
```
yarn
```

Copy example.env file and name the copy `.env` and insert your bottoken

Watch filechanges
```
yarn watch
```
Restart on filechanges
```
yarn nodemon
```

Commands should be added into the `src/commands` folder. You can use the DataLoder class, to load/save Data as a json file. By default Eula will create a localdb.json file to store the data, since a database would be a overkill for this small project.

### Deploy
To deploy Eula by yourself, you have to have docker installed, and also created your `.env` and copied over your token. You can either use the docker-compose file, or just plain docker.
